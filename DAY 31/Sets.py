# What is sets in python?
# Sets are unordered collection of data items. They store multiple items in a single variable. Set items are separated by commas and enclosed within curly brackets {}. Sets are unchangeable, meaning you cannot change items of the set once created. Sets do not contain duplicate items.
# Example:
info = {"Carla", 19, False, 5.9}
print(info)

# Creating an empty set
# Example:
set = {}
print(type(set))
